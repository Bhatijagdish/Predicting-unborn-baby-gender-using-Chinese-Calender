# Predicting-unborn-baby-gender-using-Chinese-Calender
Hello Friends, This is fun model I've created using Python to predict unborn baby's gender based upon Chinese Calender that will be calculating on the basis of mother's age during conception and month of conception(LMP).
This will also guide you to plan your baby if you either like to have a boy or girl.
